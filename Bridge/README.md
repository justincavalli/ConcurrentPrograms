A two-lane road narrows into one single lane on a bridge. There are cars coming both ways. Start with the code provided hereDownload here, and add synchronization so that the cars don't collide!

The GUI should be self-explanatory; using the two buttons you can add cars entering from the right or the left, respectively. Without synchronization, you will see the cars colliding on the bridge.

Once you look at the code, you will see that there is already a TrafficController class, but it is not doing anything. Your task is to make it work for controlling the cars passing on the bridge. We recommend that you use the simple monitor mechanisms in class Object and not the more sophisticated tools in java.util.concurrent for this exercise.

Here is an image of what you should see:
